"""One lazily-created boto3 client per AWS service, shared by the whole process.


boto3 *clients* are thread-safe, which matters because the Planner and the Analysis
engine fan LLM calls out over a ThreadPoolExecutor. Creating a client is the slow part
(it resolves credentials and loads the service model), so each is built once.


Credentials are never read from code or env vars here: on ECS the task role supplies them
through the container credentials endpoint, and locally boto3 uses whatever
`aws configure` / AWS_PROFILE gave it.
