"""Per-session cache of Analysis Agent results that already computed a
plausible table once, keyed by entry id. Mirrors feature_cache.py exactly,
including what it deliberately does NOT store: only the winning
{"plan_text", "generated_code"} pair, never the result table/chart/
interpretation -- those are always recomputed fresh from a cache-replay of
the code (see analysis_engine.run_analysis), so they reflect the current
data even when the underlying computation itself doesn't need rethinking.

Stored INSIDE the analysis's own record in the session's `ANALYSES` document (key `cache`), next to
its definition and `source`, so one read gives the definition, status and final code (see
services/common/entry_store.py).

Invalidated automatically if the entry's own calculation basis changes (a
different formula/calculation_intent for the same id) -- see `get`.
