"""The Analysis Agent: turns one analysis_repository.json entry into a
computed chart. Every entry -- however it was authored (a predefined
analysis spec, a Planner recommendation, a PM's typed request, an AI
suggestion, or a PM-triggered drilldown) -- has already been reduced to a
plain-English `calculation_intent` by the time it reaches here (see
analysis_repository.py), so this agent has one job regardless of source:
THINK about how to aggregate it, WRITE the pandas code, pick a CHART TYPE
for the resulting table (unless one was already chosen), and INTERPRET the
chart -- all via OpenRouter, never Groq.
The chart itself is drawn from the real table by analysis_charts.py, never
by the LLM. Generated code is never trusted at face value: it runs through
the same AST-sandboxed executor as the Feature Agent (ai_code_executor.py).
Entries that fit a deterministic template skip this agent's code path
entirely (see analysis_engine.py / analysis_templates.py).
