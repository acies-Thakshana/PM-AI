"""Per-session feature repository: the single place every candidate feature
lands, regardless of which of the four sources proposed it --

  predefined   -- parsed from the uploaded Customer KPI Profile file
  planner      -- Planner Agent recommendations the PM approved
  custom       -- typed directly into the Features page by the PM
  ai_suggested -- proposed by the AI feature-suggestion agent

`predefined` and `planner` are derived, not stored -- they always reflect
whatever is currently in the KPI-profile store / that session's
PLAN#<n> documents, so re-uploading a KPI Profile or re-approving planner
recommendations is picked up automatically. `custom` and `ai_suggested`
are the only entries actually persisted, inside the FEATURES document (their
accept/reject state and PM-authored content can't be re-derived from
anywhere else). Every read rebuilds the full merged view.
