"""Turns the deterministic findings from data_audit.py into (1) a short,
plain-English "data analyst" narrative and (2) a concrete per-finding
recommendation -- including which of the finding's own decision options the
agent thinks the user should pick -- via Groq. This is the only LLM call in
the audit pipeline: it never decides what the issues ARE or fixes anything
itself, it just explains what was already found and advises what to do about
each one. There is no fallback: if Groq isn't configured or the call fails,
that's a real error and the caller (routers/audit.py) surfaces it as one --
the audit agent is required, not optional.
