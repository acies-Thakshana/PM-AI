"""Turns the deterministic findings from data_audit.py into a short,
plain-English "data analyst" narrative via Groq. This is the only LLM call
in the audit pipeline -- it never decides what the issues are or fixes
anything itself, it just explains what was already found. There is no
fallback: if Groq isn't configured or the call fails, that's a real error
and the caller (routers/audit.py) surfaces it as one -- the audit agent is
required, not optional.
