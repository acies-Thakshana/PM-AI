"""Wraps the DeepL translation API for the small, fixed set of English
phrases the report builder itself writes onto a slide -- headings, captions,
footer legal text, and the highlight-label keywords (e.g. "Avg", "Highest").
This is NEVER handed a data value (a column name, pivot name, or category
value from the uploaded spreadsheet) -- a literal business term or proper
noun isn't safe to run through a translator, so the report builder only
ever translates its own authored words and splices data back in untouched
around them (see report_generator.py's TRANSLATABLE_PHRASES and
translate_highlight_label).

Silently falls back to the original English text -- for one phrase, or for
the whole batch -- if no API key is configured, the target language isn't
one DeepL supports, or the API call itself fails (network error, rate
limit, etc). Translating the report is a nice-to-have; it should never be
the reason a report download fails.
