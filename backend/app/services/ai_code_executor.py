"""Sandboxed execution for AI-generated pandas calculations. Used only by
the "ai_generated" feature type (see feature_engineering.py), when no
existing template -- lookup, extract_month, ratio, duration_hours,
custom_formula -- can express the requested calculation.

Generated code is never trusted at face value: it's AST-validated against
an allowlist before it's compiled, and executed with no builtins beyond a
short safe list, so a hallucinated `import os`, `open(...)`, or
`df.to_csv(...)` fails closed rather than running. This mirrors the
restricted-grammar precedent already used for user-typed formulas in
feature_engineering.py's `df.eval(engine="python")` -- "restricted, not
general Python" -- just extended to cover a full code snippet instead of a
single expression.

This is a practical sandbox suitable for an internal ops tool where the
"attacker" is an LLM occasionally reaching for a convenient-but-unsafe
API, not a hardened defense against a deliberately adversarial prompt.
