"""AI agent that looks at the audited + feature-engineered dataframe's
columns/dtypes and proposes candidate pivot tables. Groq only picks WHICH
existing columns to group/aggregate and writes the rationale -- it never
computes a value itself. Every suggestion is constrained to the aggregation
types pivot_engine.py can actually execute, and anything referencing a
column that doesn't exist in the current data (a hallucination) is dropped
rather than surfaced, since a broken suggestion is worse than a missing one.

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a data analyst proposing pivot tables for an \
operational cold-chain shipment dataset, to help a program manager spot \
trends and outliers for a recurring report. You'll be given the current \
column names, dtypes, and a few sample values per column (some columns may \
be engineered fields like "Country of Origin", "Arrival Month", or \
"% In Spec").

Propose up to 5 NEW pivot table ideas that would be genuinely useful for \
cold-chain reporting (e.g. performance by carrier, seasonality by product, \
exception hours by lane). Every suggestion MUST reference only columns that \
appear in the given column list -- never invent a column name -- and every \
metric's "agg" MUST be exactly one of: sum, mean, count, min, max, median, \
distinct_count, pct_of_total.

- "group_by": 1-2 column names to group rows by.
- "metrics": 1-3 objects, each {"column": <name>, "agg": <one of the above>, \
"output_label": <short display label>}. Only pick numeric columns for sum/ \
mean/min/max/median. "count", "distinct_count", and "pct_of_total" work on \
any column and describe row counts/shares, so prefer an identifier-like \
column (e.g. a trip/shipment id) for those.
- "sort_by" (optional): {"metric": <one of this pivot's output_label \
values>, "direction": "asc" or "desc"}.
- "top_n" (optional): integer cap on rows returned.

Respond with ONLY a JSON object of this exact shape, no markdown, no \
commentary:
{"suggestions": [
  {
    "name": "short title, e.g. 'Exception Hours by Carrier'",
    "description": "one plain-English sentence on why this is useful",
    "group_by": ["Carrier"],

    "sort_by": {"metric": "Shipments", "direction": "desc"},
