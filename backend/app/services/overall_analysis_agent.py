"""Turns the deterministic highlights from overall_analysis.py into a short
executive-summary narrative via Groq. This is the only LLM call in the
overall-analysis pipeline -- it never computes a number itself, only
explains the highlights already given, same guardrail as audit_agent.py.
There is no fallback: if Groq isn't configured or the call fails, that's a
real error and the caller surfaces it as one.
